# DiceCoefficient_Python
With regard to 2D and 3D objects in space, it can be useful to know certain
information regarding their relative positions in space.
Of specific interest here is the question of whether the two objects overlap and
the degree to which they are similar. 

When two objects occupy the same points in space, we can also condiser them to be similar.
How similar (or disimilar) they are is often referred to as their 
[Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient).

Here I've created functions that allow you to create a 2D rectangles of given dimensions and 
then calculate their area, overlap, and their amount of similarity, Or Dice coefficient.
